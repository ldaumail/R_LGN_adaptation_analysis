# R_LGN_adaptation_analysis
### Statistical analyses of the rapid visual adaptation manuscript were performed on R
## This repository hosts the following analyses:
## -Adaptation analysis:
## *LMMs fit of the peaks and troughs (individual_channels_analysis_origpeaks_KRpvalcorr.R)
## *Some t-tests(dependent_t_test_normality_test.R)
## *Bootstrap analysis (bootstrap_anal.R)
## *Effect size (cohens_d_plots.R)
## *plots(violin_plots_edited.R)
## -Binocular interaction analysis:
## *LMs fit of linear trends/anovas and effect sizes (contrast_Pk1vsPk4_and_Mono_vs_Bino_interaction.R)
## *Other attempts to fit better models to the data to test for interaction (all_Trends_and_monovsBino_interaction.R)
