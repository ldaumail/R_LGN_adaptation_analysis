# R_LGN_adaptation_analysis

This repository hosts the following analyses:
-Adaptation analysis:
*LMMs fit of the peaks and troughs 

*Effect size (cohens_d_plots.R)
*plots
-Binocular interaction
*LMs fit of linear trends/anovas and effect sizes (contrast_Pk1vsPk4_and_Mono_vs_Bino_interaction.R)
*Other attempts to fit better models to the data to test for interaction (all_Trends_and_monovsBino_interaction.R)
